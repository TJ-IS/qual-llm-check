## Abstract

Social Trading platforms combine the trading functionalities of classical online broker services with the communication and interaction features of social networks. Next to following other users’ profiles, a main characteristic of social trading platforms is the possibility to follow other users by automatically copying their trades. By being a technologically based financial intermediary that enables individual profit maximization, social trading platforms constitute a contemporary example of financialization. Our empirical analysis of the behavior of traders on a social trading platform provides new insights on financialization related questions regarding the influence of transparency and interaction in delegated investment environments. The disposition effect is a well-studied behavioral bias of investors and traders. Human investors tend to realize returns of their winning positions too early and let unfavorable positions accumulate losses for too long. We find that on social trading platforms the traders’ sensitivity to the disposition effect is influenced by the amount of attention they receive from their followers who invested capital into the traders’ strategy. These novel insights propose a link between principal-agent theory and the disposition effect induced by transparency mechanisms. We extend the literature on trader-investor interaction channels in social trading networks. The results obtained in a social network environment are of high relevance for regulators who have a strong focus on customer protection and financial services regulation. They also provide guidelines for platform designers, traders, investors and social trading platform operators. Journal of Information Technology (2016). doi:10.1057/s41265-016-0028-0

## Introduction

F <sup>inancialization</sup> <sup>describes</sup> <sup>‘‘the</sup> <sup>increasing</sup> <sup>role</sup> <sup>of</sup> <sup>financial</sup>motives, financial markets, financial actors and financial motives, financial markets, financial actors and financial institutions in the operation of the domestic and international economies’’ (Epstein, 2005: 3), which results ‘‘in a structural transformation of economies, firms (including financial institutions), states and households’’ (Aalbers, 2015: 3). It is considered to be the politically inadvertent solution to current economic problems (Buchanan, 2016) such as the diminished trust of private persons into institutional investors (Lagoarde-Segot, 2016). Thereby, financialization focuses on the benefit of actors within financial markets (Aalbers, 2008) where profit is generated through financial channels rather than productive means (Buchanan, 2016). Symptomatically, personal speculative trading in form of day trading or foreign exchange transactions has seized unprecedented market shares over the past years (Lagoarde-Segot, 2016). These developments are considered to be mainly driven by information technology, which decreases the cost of traded assets for households (Philippon, 2015). Therefore, in conjunction with the accelerated digitization of the financial industry, financialization has provided leeway for the development of market innovations such as technologically supported (dis-)intermediation (Currie and Lagoarde-Segot, 2016).

In this regard, particularly social trading networks are becoming increasingly relevant as disintermediating platforms that provide a high degree of transparency for investors. Social trading platforms, on the one hand, embody financialization by providing individuals with further means of generating profits through purely financial channels like speculative trading (Doering et al., 2015). Accordingly, the platform www. zulutrade.com – henceforth Zulutrade, which is subject to our analysis – reports a total trading volume of more than \$8.6 billion since its inception in 2008 (www.zulutrade.com). On the other hand, social trading also helps to address problems associated with financialization. Specifically, they satisfy the increasing need for transparency and trust, either due to regulatory requirements (e.g., the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II – MiFID2) or due to the diminishing trust in incumbent financial service providers (Sapienza and Zingales, 2012; Alt and Puschmann, 2012; Ba and Pavlou, 2002) and online services in general (Jøsang et al., 2007).

Given the currently strong trend towards disintermediation of financial services (e.g., Blockchain technology, peer-to-peer lending), social trading is a candidate for disrupting incumbent asset management services. However, social trading is a novel service for online trading and investing, which has barely been researched so far (Neumann et al., 2015; Pan et al., 2012) and, hence, is not as well understood as comparable incumbent investment delegation services like fund management or asset management. Research on social trading platforms has been limited to the analysis of whether traders can gain profits from social trading platforms at all (Pan et al., 2012; Abbey and Doukas, 2015; Neumann et al., 2015). We consider social trading to be relevant for information systems researchers, because this type of service platform has the potential to simultaneously address two core aspects of financialization. Its features enable full transparency for investors and near-real time resolution control over the investor’s invested capital, which enables individual investors to maximize their profit. These features imply both great possibilities (e.g., allocating capital to skilled and more experiences investors while bypassing unnecessary intermediaries) as well as risks (e.g., loss of invested money due to overly risky investment strategies). The ability to leverage the full potential of these electronic markets and financial services, however, depends on the design of their functionalities and integrated services for investors to enable trust and alleviate interaction and transaction (Ba and Pavlou, 2002). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the influence of the designinherent transparency on trader behavior.

Against the backdrop of these developments, we focus our research on cooperation and influencing channels of interaction in online trading environments, specifically in the context of social trading. The goal of this work is to provide answers to the underlying research question:

## How is trader behavior influenced by real-time interaction with the investors?

In search for answers, we analyze the behavior of traders on one of the leading social trading platforms – www.zulutrade.com – to obtain novel insights and extend the knowledge on behavior in fully digitized, transparent financial trading environments.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In ‘‘Social trading background’’ section, we start with a review of social trading platforms in general. Afterwards, we provide an overview of day trading and foreign exchange trading, which is the predominant type of investment on social trading platforms. In ‘‘Related literature and hypotheses development’ section we review the related literature, derive theoretical hypotheses and propose our research model which is empirically validated in ‘‘Empirical analysis’’ section. ‘‘Discussion section provides a critical reflection on our research approach. We conclude with a general overview of the contributions and limitations of this work in ‘‘Conclusion’’ section.

## Social trading background

This section provides a short introduction to social trading to highlight the features and functionalities that define the novel online broker service in relation to other social media platforms and traditional investor-broker relationships as well as provide an overview over related social trading literature.

## Functionalities of social trading platforms

Social trading platforms provide the infrastructure to display profiles of users (in this context traders) to other users in a fashion that is similar to social networks. The displayed profile information contains performance and risk metrics of the users’ trading activities. Trades of users are visible to every other user on a per trade basis, i.e. every trading decision is made public thereby introducing full transparency.

Users can copy other users’ trades with a single click. Copying means that the same trade is executed in the copying user’s online broker account. This distinguishing feature is known as copy-trading. From a technological perspective, this is achieved by linking accounts. Users’ platform trading accounts are directly linked to their online broker accounts. The operator is often an online brokerage company. However, the operator and the broker can be different institutions as well. Figure 1 provides a generalized visualization of the technical design of a social trading platform.

The resulting dependency between traders and their followers is comparable to that in traditional delegated portfolio management. In the traditional portfolio management setup investors delegate their capital to portfolio managers in order to invest the capital on the investors behalf. Consequently, the relationship bears a similar moral hazard as a result of the principal-agent connection between trader and follower (Bhattacharya and Pfleiderer, 1985; Stoughton, 1993). That is the portfolio manager (agent) might have an incentive to maximize his own profit instead of the investor’s profit. If his incentives are not tightly linked to the performance of his investment decisions (e.g., he receives a yearly share of the total amount invested regardless of the performance), the incentive to maximize performance for the investors might not be strong enough. This can be mitigated by performance bound incentives, enabling monitoring of the agents behavior and increased possibilities control (Farnsworth and Taylor, 2006). A fundamental difference to the traditional principal-agent relationship is the level of transparency regarding actions and decisions made by agents (traders). While in the traditional principal-agent situation an investor only gets periodic portfolio performance summaries, every single opening of a position and every decision to close a position can be monitored in real time by every follower (principal) on a social trading platform. Due to the direct linking of accounts, investors can immediately withdraw their capital from a trader at almost no costs. In traditional asset management, investors face far longer lead times for fund withdrawal and comparably less transparency, especially with respect to costs.

Figure 1 Generic social trading platform design.

Most social trading platforms primarily focus on foreign exchange (FX) trading and facilitate day trading by their tool setup. Therefore, they concur with the general financialization related increase in speculative trading, which have resulted in a global daily FX transaction turnover of \$9 trillion (Lagoarde-Segot, 2016). This focus has historical reasons as online trading communities based on forums (Antweiler and Frank, 2004) have a long tradition in FX trading. The digitization has brought these communities to the next level of automated trade and strategy copying in the form of social trading platforms. Furthermore, trading of currencies is less regulated and markets for major currencies are known to be the most liquid markets. Thus, adverse price effects like market impact costs of copied trades are very unlikely to negatively influence followers’ performance (e.g., in an illiquid market, the trade of a follower could be executed at a worse price due to a lack of supply for the traded asset and hence higher quoted prices).

## Day trading and FX trading

Day trading and foreign exchange trading follow different conventions and standards in comparison to stock or fund trading. This section provides a general introduction to some peculiarities in order to enhance the understanding for the trading environment and the relevant variables.

A fundamental concept in FX trading is the notion of a ‘‘lot’’. A lot is the unit for the size of a trade and one lot usually refers to a trade size of \$100.000. The profit in FX trading is often measured in pips where one pip represents the smallest change of the price for a currency pair. Prices of currency pairs are usually quoted with a precision of four digits, so the smallest change in price is a change on the fourth digit by one, i.e. one pip (Garner, 2012).

To increase the returns on investment given these small changes in prices, investors can leverage their exposure, often up to a leverage of 1:100 or even more. That means investors only invest 1/100th of the actual traded amount but fully participate on the return (positive or negative) on the actual traded amount. The followers on the platform can decide about the leverage that is applied when a trade is copied. This decision can be set to a default value for every copied trade or on a per trade basis. It follows that considering the level of returns of a trade is not a valid indicator for the actual return of a trader’s followers. We can only know with certainty if the trade had a positive or negative return. The actual realized return depends on each follower’s individual leverage decision for their copy of the trade (Garner, 2012).

FX traders are usually day traders, i.e. they are opening and closing positions within a single day (Bjønnes et al., 2005; Bjønnes and Rime, 2005; Breedon and Ranaldo, 2013).

## Remuneration and incentive schemes

According to Neumann et al. (2015), there are three generic remuneration schemes in social trading for brokers in general: Follower-based, profit-based and volume-based. The Followerbased model compensates traders based on the actual number of followers. The more followers a trader has, the higher the compensation, irrespective of the trader’s or followers’ performances. Profit-based remuneration means that the traders participate on the profits of the trades that are executed in the accounts of their followers. In volume-based models, traders share the profit from premiums imposed on execution prices for follower trades with the platform operating broker. The prices at which a follower trade is executed are slightly higher to compensate the broker and the trader. It follows that the more trades are executed in follower accounts, the higher the revenue for a trader. Note that the trades need not be winning trades (i.e., trades with positive return when they are closed) in order to let the trader make revenue.

Incentives on Zulutrade follow a volume-based model. A trader receives an absolute amount in pips for each lot that is executed by their followers. Additionally, they earn the return on their own trades given the case they execute trades with their own capital.

It is crucial for our latter argumentation that on Zulutrade traders do not necessarily need to trade with actual money. They can simply provide paper trades (trades that are executed without placing any money) in their accounts and profit from followers that automatically execute these trades with their capital. Whether traders simply conduct paper trades or invest actual money naturally has strong implications for the moral hazard and agency problems hypotheses, which will be discussed later in ‘‘Subjective biases on individual trading performance’’ section.

Economic and theoretical aspects of the social trading industry Social trading platforms developed following the general dissemination of social media tools and, therefore, constitute a comparatively young phenomenon. While a large number of platform providers have arisen, the two most prominent examples with the largest user numbers are eToro (4.5 million users) and Zulutrade (1 million users) (Robinson, 2014). The platforms differ regarding the traded instruments (most commonly mentioned are Forex, Indices, Commodities, Shares, and ETFs). During the initial phase of dissemination, these platforms annually enabled \$40 million revenue through FX trading accounting for 0.5% of the global market (Falkner and Corsthwaite, 2013).While it is generally difficult to obtain independently published figures, Wikifolio reports an annual trading volume of \$300 million in 2014 (Oehler et al., 2016) and Zulutrade claims a transaction volume of over \$917 billion since its inception in 2007 (Zulutrade, 2016).

Due to the growing adoption and substantial economic prospects, social trading has already been subject to several studies. First research addressed concerns regarding the performance and reliability of social trading. Comparing the returns of social trading certificates to respective benchmark market indexes demonstrates a comparable performance of the traditional and novel investment approaches with particularly high short-term returns for the latter (Doering et al., 2015; Oehler et al., 2016). Moreover, the analysis of stock assessments posted by users on a social trading platform have been found to provide significant explanatory power for future stock returns (Chen et al., 2014; Pelster and Breitmayer, 2016). Regarding the common trading behavior, classical phenomena like ‘‘loss aversion’’ were successfully replicated by large-scale analyses of the online financial communities (Liu et al., 2014). These results document the relevance and transferability of the findings on social trading platforms to other trading environments. Due to the unique opportunity of accessing relational information on social trading sites, further research has investigated the influence of social factors on the individual trading behavior. Pan et al. (2012) found higher returns for trades copied from platformdependent expert traders compared to individually selfinitiated trades. However, they also found preliminary evidence that the assessment of expertise does not only depend on objective performance measures but also on social cues (e.g., follower numbers). In a more targeted analysis,

Wohlgemuth et al. (2016) consequently found that expert trustworthiness depends on objective performance measures (i.e., profitable trades, returns, maximum losses, and risk level) as well as on social cues (i.e., profile pictures, displaying the real name, and interaction frequency). In order to improve the selection of experts, researchers proposed an algorithmic system that helps to identify and visualize expert traders based on their performance, risk, and consistency history (Lee and Ma, 2015). Furthermore, platform enabled social cues on individual (i.e., detailed decision information from peers) and network levels (i.e., aggregated decisions from the crowd) have been found to improve the risk management of otherwise risk averse investors (Zhao et al., 2015) by reducing under-diversification (Baghestanian et al., 2015). This effect, however, partially depends on the way in which the related peer information is framed. Prominently displaying the highest earning trader can actually increase the risk affinity of the other users (Baghestanian et al., 2015). This is particularly relevant, since especially traders with a good past performance publicly present their strategies (Amman and Schaub, 2016), which might move people to underestimate risks. Interestingly, however, it is not the information but rather the sentiment of the trader communication that drives the followers’ investment behavior (Amman and Schaub, 2016).Thus, in general it can be seen that social trading platforms offer a unique opportunity for researchers to investigate the impact of social characteristics on trading behavior, which we will elaborate in the subsequent section.

## Related literature and hypotheses development

## Measuring individual trading performance

The goal of this paper is to identify influences on the decision making of traders in fully transparent trading environments. We first consider how to measure trading performance and how to identify known influences and agency-related biases that affect traders in general and might have an impact on traders on social trading platforms as well.

A common metric for the skill or success of any trader is the ratio of trades with positive returns (henceforth winratio) (Dewally et al., 2009). Considering that day trading and especially FX trading allow high levels of leverage, followers can yield a much higher return on a trade if they copy the trade and apply a high individual leverage. Accordingly, in an expert interview the customer support of Zulutrade mentioned winratio a key measure for customers to focus on when assessing the quality of traders. Therefore, Zulutrade recommends new platform users – irrespective of their experience in financial markets – to select traders mainly by the overall winratio, among other variables like age of the account.

Moreover, the winratio depends solely on the decision of the traders to close any of the open trades that provide a positive return independent of the level of the return. Put differently, the winratio performance measure reacts immediately to any changes in the decision makers’ behavior but still captures the quality of the trader decisions (number of positive trades). Return levels do not capture this behavioral decision dimension as they can hardly be influenced by traders. This is essential in this case, as we investigate exactly these immediate changes in the behavior and decision making of traders. The individual trader’s performance and decision making is not only based on skill and ability levels but has been found to be affected through certain behavioral and social characteristics, as we elaborate in the following.

## Subjective biases on individual trading performance

It has long been proposed by the efficient market hypothesis that stock prices objectively reflect all related information at the given time (Fama, 1970, 1998). New information is instantly processed by the markets, which establishes a price equilibrium and precludes misspecification of stocks (Lo, 2004). In this sense, prices are objectively justified and returns are independent from subjective characteristics of the trader. Criticism of this perspective has been fueled by events like financial crises due to overrated market estimations (Shiller, 2015) and empirical findings that show the noncompliance of stock price movements with company fundamentals (Cornell, 2013). This has given rise to the assumption of behavioral finance that irrational human behavior can affect stock market reactions. As one of the most prominent, (Keynes, 2013) argued that subjective impacts like sentiment or conventional valuations affect human long-term expectations and investment decisions beyond rational fact-based judgement. The establishment of financialization in academic finance research corresponds with this development to a certain degree. Academic finance relied on the ‘representative idiom’ which assumes an objectively identifiable financial reality – like the efficient market hypothesis – represented by an empirical equivalent (Lagoarde-Segot, 2016). Behavioral finance, however, considers an objectivist world view to be somewhat outdated (Orlean, 2012). Correspondingly, financialization researchers follow the ‘performative idiom’, which allows for external factors to influence multiple realities of economic agents (Lagoarde-Segot, 2016). Consequently, researchers call for multidisciplinary approaches to purposefully address financialization and behavioral finance (Aalbers, 2015; Orlean, 2012). Therefore, we refer to findings from behavioral finance on subjective effects to evaluate the individual trading performance. Social trading platforms have been found to be a particularly viable environment to study subjective effects on trading behavior, because of their key features regarding transparent social network structures and immediate communicative exchanges (e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Wohlgemuth et al., 2016). In line with the aforementioned social trading research, we consider errors of human judgement due to the attention from others (i.e., behavioral and relational biases) to be particularly relevant (Shiller, 2005).

## Behavioral biases and patterns of day traders

A trader can close trades prematurely to guarantee capturing a positive return. If an open position would yield a negative return, traders can decide to wait if the position yields a positive return later on. In behavioral finance, these two behavioral patterns are known as the ‘‘disposition effect’’. It states that investors are likely to close a winning trade too early and to avoid closing a trade at a loss for too long (Shefrin and Statman, 1985). It is one of the most prominent stylized facts in behavioral finance and empirically validated over time, different asset classes, countries and known to affect professional and novice investors alike (Weber and Camerer, 1998). It is sometimes also referred to as ‘‘sign preference effect’’ (Ben-David and Hirshleifer, 2012). Figure 2 depicts the different scenarios regarding the disposition effect and the timing of the closing of a trade which makes the difference (for a more detailed overview of the relevance and difficulty of timing specifically for FX trading, we recommend Rosov and Foster (2014)). In the context of social trading, the disposition effect has been found to be reduced through mirror trading of expert strategies (Liu et al., 2014). Since, however, pure mirror trading approaches only account for two percent of the trades initiated over the platforms (Pan et al., 2012), the respectively mitigating effects can be considered to be rather low.

Given the previous discussion regarding behavioral performance drivers, for social trading platforms we hypothesize:

H1 The timing of trades significantly affects the trader performance.

H2 Letting losing positions accumulate losses and prematurely closing winning positions biases the trader performance.

Apart from the behavioral drivers of trader performance, the broker’s portfolio focus/diversity has been found to influence the investment behavior. For example, Chen and Lai (2015) compared concentrated investment styles (i.e., investors focusing on only a few different assets) to less concentrated, $\mathrm { i . e . , }$ overconfident ones (i.e. investors feeling able to assess many different assets simultaneously and with the same quality). They find that fund managers exhibit higher performance if they concentrate on few stocks. Furthermore, Hiraki et al. (2015) show that industryconcentrated funds outperform more diversified peers. Specifically for FX trading, Jacobs and Weber (2015) find that distraction (induced by following different assets) of traders results in a negative influence on their performance. Hence, we hypothesize:

![](/api/attachments/D863QUBZ/fulltext/images/f08d25a5f69508165a44da6071020387cc73234e7b1f8b5a06e491400e3b5831.jpg)  
Figure 2 Disposition effect related scenarios of timing the closing of a trade.

H3 Focusing on particular instruments improves trader performance compared to diversified investment.

Lastly, behavioral finance research has investigated the role of the level of trading activity on performance. The prominent work of Barber and Odean (2002) shows that individual online retail investors tend to perform worse when they increase their trading frequency. However, Abbey and Doukas (2015) find for individual currency traders that an increased turnover is associated with higher performance. This is in line with the findings of Dewally et al. (2009) for non-Household traders. An extended review of profiles of traders on Zulutrade revealed that traders are often experienced FX traders. They either have a professional background in finance and trading or document a strong dedication to trading as part time job or additional source of personal income. Hence, we assume that the sample comprises primarily non-Household investors and hypothesize:

H4 An increased trading experience positively affects the trader performance.

## Moral hazard in delegated investment setups

In social trading environments, traders and investors are tied together in a classical principal-agent setup (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991). The setup is comparable to delegated portfolio management (Bhattacharya and Pfleiderer, 1985; Fernandes et al., 2010). In general, agency theory explains the forces on relationships in transactional environments where either party is following personal interests and uncertainty prevails due to information asymmetry, i.e., imperfect monitoring capabilities (Pavlou et al., 2007). The agent performs actions on behalf of the principal. The principal cannot perfectly monitor the agent’s behavior but has to rely on the incentives and motives that are guiding the agent’s decision on the investor’s behalf. For example, an investor has invested a share of the personal capital into a fund of a professional manager. The principal cannot fully monitor the motives and incentives guiding the professional investor but has to rely on the incentive of the fund manager who is rewarded based on the performance. For portfolio management these relationships are extensively studied in different literature streams. For instance, Evans (2008) reports the decrease of agency costs and decrease of turnover to be associated with higher personal investments of fund managers in their own funds. A general review of relationships between compensation, incentives and risk based on an extensive theoretical analysis is provided by Ross (2004). The decisive factor for the quality of the principal-agent relationship is the moral hazard. The conceptual similarity of asset management to social trading environments (followers invest their capital in traders’ strategies) introduces a principal-agent relationship similar to the classical asset management. Hence, they face a comparable issue of moral hazard due to the previously described incentive schemes put in place to remunerate traders (Neumann et al., 2015). The moral hazard they face can be described as follows: in order to maximize their own profit they could simply increase their trading activity as they are rewarded based on lot sizes that are executed in form of copied trades in their followers broker accounts. Irrespective of the outcome of a trade, the trader would benefit from the transaction. However, traders can earn more if they attract more capital by improving the track record, i.e. the overall performance. For example, one could try to improve the winratio in terms of the number of trades that yield a positive return. One could also face a moral pressure to increase performance when followers invest more money and trust in the trader’s abilities.

If the trading performance is poor, investors can immediately withdraw their funds and the trader’s revenue would drop accordingly. In this regard, the platform mechanics on a social trading platform are particularly unique, offering solutions for that kind of moral hazard related issues:

First, monitoring capabilities of investors are fundamentally different compared to asset management. Every investor can monitor the trader’s behavior at any point in time on a per trade basis in every detail. According to principal-agent theory, the capability of the principal to monitor the agent is negatively related to the moral hazard of the agent.

Second, with linked brokerage accounts, investors’ reaction time is reduced to near-real time. Penalties for undesired behavior can thus be imposed immediately by every investor. A withdrawal of invested capital is the most radical. Leaving a comment on the public profile of the trader or providing a rating visible to others are less intense. These so called social feedback mechanisms (Ba and Pavlou, 2002; Pavlou et al., 2007) have been found to improve user generated content in online community setups (Siering and Muntermann, 2013).

Third, the incentives of volume-based compensation should intuitively expose traders to the temptation of hazardously maximizing their monetary outcome. Consequently, traders would increase the order quantity in order to increase their compensation per lot copy-traded in a follower account.

Fourth, traders that are not invested with their own money simply have an incentive profile that is similar to payout profiles of buying a stock option. The trader can earn positive returns with no monetary risks besides the premium (in this case invested time in trading on the platform).

In summary, a trader on Zulutrade has strong incentives (volume-based remuneration) to behave morally hazardous. However, the trader is aware of being monitored in real-time and in detail, while the reaction time of the followers can also be near real-time. Hence, principal-agent theory suggests that the trader is more likely to behave in the interest of the follower. These considerations lead us to the following hypothesis:

H5 Changes in the amount of invested capital improves a trader’s performance.

Investors can use the rating scale on a trader’s profile to (dis-)approve of recent decisions. Changes of the average rating of a trader indicate the general activity of investors on the profile of the trader. A change of the rating therefore shows an increased monitoring activity of investors. Consequently, we hypothesize:

Figure 3 Overview of relationships according to our research model. Variables used to capture the proposed construct are mentioned in parentheses for each construct.

H6 Changes in social feedback lead to a better trading performance.

An overview of the previously derived research model is depicted by Figure 3. We attach the variables that we operationalize to test our hypotheses to the theoretical concepts.

In the next section we explain the data set and the methodology, which we applied for empirical validation of our proposed model.

## Empirical analysis

## Data set

Through an advanced data scraping method, we were able to extend the focus of previous studies on social trading or investment delegation decision beyond the single trade focus, by simultaneously collecting a data set that includes both trader profiles and trade information.

Data regarding traders on Zulutrade is publicly available and was gathered in an automated and structured way: We scraped all trader profiles on a daily basis between 10 pm and 12 pm UTC + 2. The raw profile data set comprises profile snapshots of around 33.000 traders for each day between 06/2013 and 01/2014. Historical trades for every unique trader profile were obtained subsequently, resulting in almost 9 million trades over the years 2007 to 2014.

To reduce data noise and guarantee high data quality, the original sample of profiles and trades were pre-processed as follows: Initially, trade data was reduced to observations within the time window for which we obtained the corresponding profile data. A total of 3.79 million trades and around 33.000 profiles per day remained. It is worth noting that this vast number of daily accounts contains a high share of inactive or test accounts, which we dropped consequently. The platform is open for everyone to register and start trading, i.e., providing signals. On the one hand, this unrestricted access policy leads to a broad diversity of traders, i.e. professional and less experienced traders. On the other hand, many users register only for testing purposes and churn after a short period of time.

Based on a rule of thumb, we only consider traders that have been trading on more than two days within the observation window and for which the distance between their first and their last trade is more than four weeks to exclude test accounts. This reduces noisy data from the profiles set that actually might have one or more followers but only remain active for the four weeks test phase of a demo account. After removing all traders that are not active for at least four weeks, the final sample contains 201 traders over 216 days. Lastly, it is worth noting that – since we are working with lagged variables – the subset of traders for which we do not observe at least three consecutive trading days are dropped during the estimation procedure. Hence the results presented are estimated with n = 178 traders for T = 107 distinct days.

The trade data sample is aggregated on a daily basis. Trades that were opened and trades that were closed are counted separately for each day. Figures that are containing the numbers of both opened and closed trades on the same day are marked with the suffix ‘‘Total’’. To increase internal validity, we dropped the numerically negligible non-FX asset classes (e.g., Gold, Oil or the S&P 500 Index). Lastly, due to our focus of socially biased trading behavior, we only consider paper-traders who are not affected by additional financial return strategies. In total, the data sample comprised 428,153 single trades for the aforementioned 178 traders over a period of 107 days.

## Variable operationalization

To approximate social feedback we included ‘‘Rating’’ as the average rating from all followers who have invested capital into a traders’ strategy ranging from 0 to 5.

Moral hazard is measured through ‘‘Capital’’, which represents the total amount of USD that is invested in the traders strategy and is observed on a daily basis. As typically found in scale-free networks, capital has a skewed power law distribution, because a small number of traders capture the major share of the total capital invested (Newman and Park, 2003). Nonetheless, 50% of the traders are entrusted several thousand \$USD. To avoid potential biasing effects of the skewed distribution to a linear regression model, we considered (lagged) first order differences for our further analysis (Wooldridge, 2010).

Performance of a trader is measured by the ‘‘winratio’’ as discussed in previous chapters. Winratio is defined on a daily basis for each trader. It represents the share of trades with a positive return that a trader closed on a particular day. The share was derived from the unprocessed dataset where winning trades are flagged with a dummy that is set to 1 if the trade yields a positive return on close and is set to 0 in the case of a loss. Thus, the winratio can take values between 0 (i.e., only trades with negative or zero returns) and 1 (i.e., only trades with positive returns) for each trader for any given day (Table 1).

To measure the disposition effect, we considered ‘‘DistanceHighest’’ as the number of days between the maximum return that the trader could have realized with that particular trade and the point in time the trade was actually closed by the trader. This information is retrospectively reported by the platform operator for each single trade. Thus, this variable captures the effects of keeping less favorable trades open in the hope for higher returns in the future which is in line with the known aversion to realize a loss. A ‘‘DistanceHighest’’ around 0 means to close the trade around the (current) optimum, which can also be premature, i.e. closing a trade as long as its return is increasing.

With ‘‘Duration’’ we capture a trader’s timing represented by the time between the opening time of a trade and its closing time denoted in days. We compute the average duration over all trades that are closed on a daily basis for every trader. Last, to include the behavioral patterns in terms of a trader’s focus and activity, we considered ‘‘PairsTotal’’ (count of unique currency pairs traded) and ‘‘TradesTotal’’ (the total number of trades handled, i.e., opened and closed). Both are calculated for each trader and each day of the sample.

The pairwise correlations (Table 2) between these measures are generally low except for the average duration of trades paired with the distance to highest price, which are inherently related. Otherwise, the cross-correlations are well within acceptable limits.

## Methodology

To obtain answers to our research question, we conducted a fixed-effects panel regression. The final model is represented by Equation (1).

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {Winratio} _ {i t} = \alpha_ {i} + \beta_ {1} \Delta \text {Capital} _ {i t} + \beta_ {2} \Delta \text {Capital} _ {i t - 1} \\ \qquad + \beta_ {3} \Delta \text {Capital} _ {i t - 2} + \beta_ {4} \Delta \text {Rating} _ {i t} + \beta_ {5} \Delta \text {Rating} _ {i t - 1} \\ \qquad + \beta_ {6} \text {DistanceHighest} _ {i t} + \beta_ {7} \text {Duration} _ {i t} \\ \qquad + \beta_ {8} \text {PairsTotal} _ {i t} + \beta_ {9} \text {TradesTotal} _ {i t} \\ \qquad + \beta_ {1 0} \text {TradesTotal} _ {i t - 1} + \beta_ {1 1} \text {Experience} _ {i t} + \varepsilon_ {t i} \end{array}\tag{1}
$$

This approach enabled us to control for (1) any invariant, a priori idiosyncratic differences among the traders (i.e., personal traits, situational effects) through the restricted fixed effects assumption, (2) for a temporal learning trend (i.e., experience), and (3) the (dummy encoded) day specific changes (which are not explicitly displayed in the tables or equation for the sake of clarity) additionally to the consideration of the hypothesized focal effects of trader style and social influences (Wooldridge, 2010).

These aspects were controlled for considering that each trader in the sample could be endowed with unique tools or distinguishing personal traits. We selected a fixed-effects model, to control for individual performance altering effects because the present work focuses on systematic patterns common for all traders (Wooldridge, 2010). Time dummy variables for each day were included to rule out time-specific effects that systematically influence traders (e.g., seasonal effects, holidays, weather changes) during certain periods of time (Wooldridge, 2010). Considering, that traders learn over time and improve their performance (Chiang et al., 2011), we controlled for the progressive learning of a trader through the number of days since the trader’s first trade on the platform (i.e., experience).

Lastly, we included lagged variables of Capital, Rating, and the number of trades to enable inferences of chronological causality (i.e., repeating occurrence of events that follow each other with reasonable time delay) As reported by Abbey and Doukas (2015), a day trader’s trading activity in a previous period influences the performance of a trader in the current period. Regarding the interpretation of the metrics, we do not consider the (generally rather persistent) levels of these variables, but the first order differences in comparison to the previous period. For example, $\Delta C a p i t a l _ { i t - 1 }$ denotes the absolute change of capital invested in trader i between period t - 2 and t - 1. We tested models with higher lag lengths but could not find any remarkable differences regarding model fit or specification analytical metrics. Besides, additional lags were insignificant.

## Robustness considerations

During the course of the description of our analysis, we documented additional approaches taken to test our results against outliers, skewed distributions of explanatory variables and sub-sampling issues. In this section we briefly take account of decisions regarding our econometric estimation procedure that could systematically bias the results.

First of all, a test for unobserved effects in the individual residuals rejects the null hypothesis and, thus, justifies the modelling of individual effects through a random- or fixedeffects panel regression (Wooldridge, 2010). The choice of fixed effects estimation over random effects estimation was based on the rejection of the null hypothesis in the Hausman test procedure for misspecification (Hausman and Taylor, 1981). Lastly, we considered serial-correlation and heteroscedasticity patterns of error terms commonly found in panel regressions. Our panel data is not suffering from being a ‘‘short’’ panel set and hence the standard tests for serial correlation are feasible (Wooldridge, 2010). Both Breusch-Godfrey and Durbin-Watson tests for serial correlation both reject the null-hypothesis indicating serial correlation. Hence, we need to correct for these effects by using robust standard errors (Arellano, 1987).

## Empirical results

The results of our empirical model validation with standardized beta coefficients are presented in Table 3.

Overall, the results support our underlying assumption that on social trading platforms, the trader performance is affected by behavioral and interaction features of the platform (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = 1 3 . 7 7 \% , p < . 0 0 1 )$ . In particular, the results also support the previously hypothesized relationships.

Regarding the effect of timing (hypothesis 1) and disposition (hypothesis 2), we see that both features significantly affect trader performance. Considering the correlation of both metrics, this means that the duration of a trade is only positive as long as the position is running in the favorable direction, i.e. increasing return. As soon as the position is running in the wrong direction, i.e., moving away from highest price and possibly into the loss zone, the duration of the trade is no longer favorable. The median of DistanceHighest was 0, indicating that the majority of trades were closed as long as the trade was running in the favorable direction. Put differently, the trade was closed at the so far highest return of that trade. Thus, the results confirm hypotheses H1 and H2.

Table 3 Coefficients are reported as beta coefficients (also frequently referred to as standardized coefficients)

As suggested by our third hypothesis H3, the number of traded pairs measuring the focus of the trader is influencing the performance outcome. The more focused a trader, with respect to asset classes, the better the performance of the trades.

Hypothesis H4 is in accordance with the findings of Abbey and Doukas (2015), showing that a higher level of activity in the previous period indicates a higher performance in the current period. To test for collinearity issues, we exclude the lag of TradesTotal and find the results to be stable. TradesTotal in the current period remains insignificant.

In line with hypotheses H5, we find an increase in the capital invested in the preceding days to influence the daily winratio. We assume that two forms of influence account for this observation. First, it indicates that the trader assumes to be monitored in the current period, i.e., immediately after new investments, and is trying to please the new investor with positive returns. Second, it shows that a change in investments on the previous day causes the trader to become more prone to the disposition effect. This finding shows the link between realtime monitoring capabilities of a principal and the behavioral bias of the trader. It needs to be noted that the effect is only valid with respect to a change in the previous period.

While the results indicate support regarding the proposed social feedback hypothesis H6, the absence of a lagged effect does not allow inferring (chronological) causality from the finding. Although we see a significant coefficient for the current period first difference, we cannot establish a clear chronological order. Rating is obtained on an end of day basis, whereas winratio is determined within that same day. Thus, apart from the theoretical reasoning, we cannot provide final empirical evidence that the rating increased during the day due to the good performance of the trade, or if the trader’s performance is influenced by a higher rating in comparison to the previous day.

## Discussion

The goal of this study was to investigate how trader performance can be enhanced through the transparency and social interactions on social trading platforms. For this purpose, we collected and analyzed a panel of 178 trader profiles and their respective trade information over more than 100 days from a leading social trading platform – Zulutrade. Contrary to assumptions of the efficient market hypothesis, our results generally show that social trader performance is subject to behavioral (i.e., Disposition) and relational biases (i.e., Moral-Hazard, Social Feedback) com parable to incumbent investment environments. Furthermore, we are able to closely consider time-dependent interacting effects of the prominent disposition and moral hazard biases that impair trader returns. The disposition effect describes the tendency of a trader to prematurely close winning trades or overrun losing trades. Our results show that the disposition effect intensifies with a anteriorly increase in moral hazard expressed through capital entrusted to a trader. In other words, paying more attention to a trader enhances the trader’s urge to avoid losses even if it means passing on optimal returns. The reported effects remain stable under simultaneous control for known performance drivers such as trade duration, trade frequency, lagged trade frequency, investment focus, and experience of the trader. Lastly, one needs to acknowledge that the present empirical results do not necessarily indicate the assumed causal dependency between monitoring proxies and winratio. The positive relationship states that decreasing ratings or capital is associated with a decreasing winratio. Alternatively, it could be assumed that the effect is moderated through additional variables. This could, for example, be that a reduced monitoring from users decreases the trader’s effort or the willingness to trim publicly displayed performance metrics. It is also possible that traders focus on higher returns instead of higher winratios. Therefore, they need to take more risk and hence suffer from a higher share of trades they need to close with a loss. These additional explanations, however, do not repeal the relationship but offer venues for further research on social trading.

## Conclusion

While the efficient market hypothesis assumes stock prices to be purely rationality based, trader performance in offlinesettings has been found to be affected by a set of behavioral and social biases. Due to their key features of transparent communication and social relations, social trading platforms offer the unique opportunity to study behavioral and social impacts on trading behavior. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to combine profile and trade data from a social trading platform to analyze comparable effects in an upcoming online real-time environment of trader investor relationships. Thereby, we confirm the disposition effect for traders in the online environment of a social trading platform. This contributes to financialization research, considering that social trading represents an associated phenomenon in terms of technologically disintermediating platforms that enable maximizing individual financial profits through speculative trading. In particular, we exploit unique characteristics of the winratio performance measure and observe that traders tend to be more prone to the disposition effect in the current period if their rating or the invested capital has changed in the previous period. We conclude that traders try to improve their performance metrics when they receive more attention from the community, i.e., capital investments in the previous period or changes in the average user rating. The reported effects remain stable while controlling for established performance drivers such as trade duration, trade frequency, lagged trade frequency, attention level and experience of the trader.

These insights are relevant from a theoretical as well as practical perspective. Foremost, we extend the theoretical knowledge regarding the drivers of the prominent and wellstudied disposition effect in an innovative online trading environment. Thereby, we further supplement findings from behavioral finance contradicting the efficient market hypothesis. While social trading platforms differ substantially from the common trading environment regarding levels of transparency and types of relationships, the disposition effect is stable across settings. Even more so, the augmented exposition to investor attention seems to enhance the disposition effect while decreasing the trader performance significantly. Additionally, we extend the literature on principal-agent theory in the digitized financial service world. We show that full transparency and exertion of control does not necessarily introduce positive effects. The behavior of the agent is influenced by recognition of being monitored. Hence, the principal could inadvertently induce unfavorable behavior of the agent through monitoring. Thus, we also obtain insights on the effects of financialization related issues regarding the impact of increased transparency and deregulation (Buchanan, 2016). Moreover, we provide insights on trader behavior and the impact of social trading service features. Making traders and their performance visible to the community and enabling social feedback from investors in terms of ratings, helps to make traders act more conservatively and temporarily increase the winratio.

Therefore, platform operators can refer to these findings to improve or measure the impact of different incentive structures and monitoring capabilities provided on their platform. Based on these results, we argue that operators need to decide which type of trading behavior they would like to encourage on their platforms and design the features accordingly. If, on the one hand, high risk investment strategies with potentially maximized returns are desirable, platforms should offer only restrictive attention signaling features such as subjective user ratings. On the other hand, however, if they want to encourage rather risk-aware trading, social feedback mechanisms help to establish such behaviors. Furthermore, regulators are provided with insights regarding recently emerging financial services. As customer protection is frequently postulated and enforced by regulatory authorities, our findings can provide helpful guidance for future regulatory discussions. As such, we are able to demonstrate effects of an augmented transparency of trader behavior for regulatory and investment entities. Specifically, when investors can openly compare success measures of traders, it causes traders to trim their performance metrics even though it might not yield optimal returns. Thereby, we also address the major global aspect of financialization regarding market deregulation (Buchanan, 2016).

However, these contributions need to be considered in the light of the study’s limitations, which simultaneously provide venues for future research. In its current state, the findings might be subject to a sampling or survivorship bias. Due to our filtering methodology of only using traders who have conducted at least two trades on the platform, one might argue that more skilled traders remained in the sample which explains higher winratios. However, it needs to be noted that such a sample bias would imply that the obtained coefficients are more likely to underestimate the actual effect size. Considering that skilled traders should be less prone to react to the external and, at least for their strategy, irrelevant influences like changes of capital invested or changing of ratings. Especially since traders on Zulutrade are completely independent of the amount invested in their strategy. This is different for funds and traditional asset management setups, where traders would benefit from the volume of the portfolio they manage. However, further research is needed to investigate the assumption that this sample bias rather underestimates the effect sizes.

Regarding the generalizability of our findings, it needs to be considered that the data was obtained from one social trading platform, which is structurally different from other platforms (e.g., imposes less controls and constraints regarding admission criteria or track record evaluation for traders). Consequently, the environment could encourage rather hazardous trading behavior.

Lastly, further research in this regard could focus on changing the design of functionalities for communication between traders and followers or more elaborate recommendation systems for traders or trading strategies or incorporate other dimensions like changes of risk taking behavior in the presence of higher levels of followers and entrusted capital. This would enable to analyze more closely how risk taking is influenced by social presence, interaction or social functionalities in online trading environments.
