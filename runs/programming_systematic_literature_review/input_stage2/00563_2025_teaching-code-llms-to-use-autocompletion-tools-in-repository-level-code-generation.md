Title: Teaching Code LLMs to Use Autocompletion Tools in Repository-Level Code Generation
Abstract: Recent code large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in generating standalone functions. However, they face limitations in repository-level code generation due to their lack of awareness of repository-level dependencies (e.g., user-defined attributes), resulting in dependency errors such as undefined-variable and no-member errors. In this work, we introduce ToolGen, an approach that integrates autocompletion tools into the code LLM generation process to address these dependencies. ToolGen comprises two main phases: Trigger Insertion and Model Fine-tuning (Offline), and Tool-integrated Code Generation (Online). During the offline phase, ToolGen augments functions within a given code corpus with a special mark token, indicating positions to trigger autocompletion tools. These augmented functions, along with their corresponding descriptions, are then used to fine-tune a selected code LLM. In the online phase, ToolGen iteratively generates functions by predicting tokens step-by-step using the fine-tuned LLM. Whenever a mark token is encountered, ToolGen invokes the autocompletion tool to suggest code completions and selects the most appropriate one through constrained greedy search.We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate ToolGen's effectiveness in repository-level code generation across three distinct code LLMs: CodeGPT, CodeT5, and CodeLlama. To facilitate this evaluation, we create a benchmark comprising 671 real-world code repositories and introduce two new dependency-based metrics: Dependency Coverage and Static Validity Rate. The results demonstrate that ToolGen significantly improves Dependency Coverage by 31.4% to 39.1% and Static Validity Rate by 44.9% to 57.7% across the three LLMs, while maintaining competitive or improved performance in widely recognized similarity metrics such as BLEU-4, CodeBLEU, Edit Similarity, and Exact Match. On the CoderEval dataset, ToolGen achieves improvements of 40.0% and 25.0% in test pass rate (Pass@1) for CodeT5 and CodeLlama, respectively, while maintaining the same pass rate for CodeGPT. ToolGen also demonstrates high efficiency in repository-level code generation, with latency ranging from 0.63 to 2.34 seconds for generating each function. Furthermore, our generalizability evaluation confirms ToolGen's consistent performance when applied to diverse code LLMs, encompassing various model architectures and scales.  © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).
